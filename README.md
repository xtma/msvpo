# APO
Author's implementation of ["Mean-Semivariance Policy Optimization via Risk-Averse"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.07376).


### Installation
This code is based [my forked version](https://github.com/xtma/rlpyt) of [rlpyt](https://github.com/astooke/rlpyt). To reproduce the results in paper, please run `python run_exp.py`. Note that this python file contains all the hyperparameters I have tried on 8 GPUs. Please set your hyperparameters manually before your experiments.
